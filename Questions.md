1. Discuss your strategy and decisions implementing the application. Please, consider time
complexity, effort cost, technologies used and any other variable that you understand
important on your development process.



2. How would you change your solution to account for future columns that might be
requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or “Co-Sponsors”?


3. How would you change your solution if instead of receiving CSVs of data, you were given a
list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?



4. How long did you spend working on the assignment?
You should send us a zip file (your_full_name.zip) that contains the following:
- Source code for your implementation
- A readme with steps to run your code (readme.md)
- A writeup that responds to the questions asked above (questions.md)
